## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS FOR FRONTEND INTEGRATION**

### **Immediate Actions Required:**

1. **Create API Service Layer**
   ```javascript
   // Example structure needed in frontend
   const apiService = {
     lessonNotes: {
       getAll: () => fetch('/api/lesson-notes'),
       create: (data) => fetch('/api/lesson-notes', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(data) }),
       // ... other methods
     },
     // ... other modules
   }
   ```

2. **Replace Mock Data**
   - Update all frontend components to use real API calls
   - Remove hardcoded mock data arrays
   - Implement proper loading states

3. **Add Authentication Integration**
   - Implement JWT token handling in frontend
   - Add login/logout functionality
   - Handle token refresh

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement API error handling
   - Add user-friendly error messages
   - Handle network failures gracefully

### **Testing Recommendations:**

1. **API Testing**
   - Test all new endpoints with Postman/Insomnia
   - Verify authentication and authorization
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test frontend-backend integration
   - Verify data flow and state management
   - Test user workflows end-to-end

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load test new endpoints
   - Monitor database performance
   - Optimize slow queries if needed
